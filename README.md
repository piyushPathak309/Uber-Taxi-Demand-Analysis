#### Perform eda(exploratory data analysis means identifying missing pattern from dataset exploring the dataset) on Dataset and changed the datatype of Date/time column from object to date/time type and added some useful columns as day, month,year with help of this column after this my dataset was almost cleaned not containing any duplicates value,null values so i cleaned my dataset this way.

## DataVisualization :-
##### Performed data visualization using Seaborn and matplotlib libraries and used many charts and graphs some of them are as i used Bar chart to see the frequency of Uber Rider by weekdays and found that Thursday is most busiest day, plot histogram of hour and found that on evening time is crowd is on peak and so on.. this way I performed visualization and derive many useful insights.

## Insights :- I Derived many insights some of them are-
### -> The much rush/crowd on thursday.
### -> In Evening Time the rush is on peak because work time almost ends at evening time.
### -> In september month means in 9th month has highest uber rides.
### -> Base Number B02617 getting more popular by month wise.
